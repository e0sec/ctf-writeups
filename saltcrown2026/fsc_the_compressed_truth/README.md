# FSC — The Compressed Truth
**Forensic Analysis Writeup**

---

## Overview

The artefact provided is a partial disk image from Veylen Marr's workstation, containing the user registry hive at `C:\Users\vmarr\NTUSER.DAT`. The operative CROWQUILL authenticated to the machine using stolen credentials and carried out a full intelligence collection and exfiltration operation against the Shard Reference Registry. No external forensic tooling was available in the analysis environment; a minimal Windows registry (regf) parser was written from scratch in Python to interrogate the hive directly.

The narrative explicitly flags 7-Zip as the source of ground truth: *"7-Zip does not forget which folders were opened, which paths were browsed, and where the staging began."* All answers derive from three 7-Zip registry keys — `Software\7-Zip\Extraction`, `Software\7-Zip\Compression`, and `Software\7-Zip\FM` — plus supporting Explorer artifacts.

```

## Methodology

The hive was parsed by implementing the `regf` cell format in Python: reading `nk` (key) nodes, `vk` (value) nodes, and `lf`/`lh`/`li`/`ri` subkey list structures directly from the raw binary. No third-party libraries were used.

Key registry paths interrogated:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Software\7-Zip\Extraction` | Records extraction destinations (PathHistory) |
| `Software\7-Zip\Compression` | Records archive creation paths (ArcHistory) |
| `Software\7-Zip\FM` | Records folder navigation (FolderHistory, CopyHistory, PanelPath) |
| `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs` | File access recency and MRU ordering |
| `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist` | Executed programs (ROT-13 decoded) |

## Findings

### Q1 — The Credential Extraction Tool

**Answer: `KeeFarce`**

The `Software\7-Zip\Extraction\PathHistory` value records the destination used when CROWQUILL extracted a tool onto the machine:

```
C:\Users\vmarr\AppData\Local\Temp\writ\KeeFarce\
```

KeeFarce is a publicly documented post-exploitation tool that injects into a running KeePass process and exports the decrypted credential database from memory — lifting the key while it is still held, exactly as the brief describes. The presence of `KeePass Password Safe 2\KeePass.exe` in the UserAssist and NotifyIconSettings keys confirms KeePass was installed and had been launched on this machine.

---

### Q2 — When the Tool Was Extracted

**Answer: `2026-06-18 13:15:15`**

The `Software\7-Zip\Extraction` registry key carries a LastWrite timestamp of **2026-06-18 13:15:15.280444 UTC**. This timestamp is updated by Windows the moment 7-Zip writes the extraction path to the key — i.e., the moment CROWQUILL extracted KeeFarce onto the machine.

---

### Q3 — Deepest Folder Enumerated Inside the Archive

**Answer: `C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2.zip\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2\saltoaths_secretive\`**

The `Software\7-Zip\FM\FolderHistory` value (a REG_MULTI_SZ) records every folder navigated in the 7-Zip File Manager, most-recent first. Three consecutive entries document CROWQUILL opening and descending into `oath_records_cinderbound_vol2.zip`:

```
[13] C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2.zip\
[14] C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2.zip\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2\
[15] C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2.zip\oath_records_cinderbound_vol2\saltoaths_secretive\
```

Entry `[15]` is the deepest point reached inside the archive before the operative moved on.

---

### Q4 — Staging Location

**Answer: `c:\users\public\music\saltwork\`**

The `Software\7-Zip\FM\CopyHistory` value records the destination paths supplied to 7-Zip's copy dialog. Both entries point to the same location:

```
c:\users\public\music\saltwork\
c:\users\public\music\saltwork
```

This is where CROWQUILL copied the stolen records — a publicly writable directory chosen to avoid raising suspicion. The `FolderHistory` places `saltwork` as the second-most-recently-visited folder (index `[1]`), immediately before the final `desktop\working` session, consistent with the operative staging files here immediately before compression.

---

### Q5 — Name of the Exfiltration Archive

**Answer: `shardchain.tar`**

The `Software\7-Zip\Compression\ArcHistory` value records the full path of the last archive created:

```
C:\Users\Public\Pictures\shardchain.tar
```

This is corroborated by `Explorer\RecentDocs\.tar`, which lists `shardchain.tar` as the only `.tar` file recently accessed (LastWrite: **2026-06-18 13:24:55**), and by the `Compression` key LastWrite of **2026-06-18 13:25:06** — the moment the archive was sealed.

---

### Q6 — Location of the Master Secrets Store

**Answer: `C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\shard_storage\ShardKeepass_FirstMark\`**

The `FolderHistory` records CROWQUILL navigating directly into the KeePass vault folder:

```
[8]  C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\shard_storage\
[9]  C:\Users\vmarr\Documents\Registry\shard_storage\ShardKeepass_FirstMark\
```

The name `ShardKeepass_FirstMark` identifies this as the KeePass database holding credentials for every shard catalogued in the Registry — the master store that KeeFarce was brought onto the machine to unlock. With it, Cassian holds the authority to reconstruct custody chains for every shard the Registry has ever tracked.

---

### Q7 — Where CROWQUILL Concluded Operations

**Answer: `c:\users\vmarr\desktop\working\`**

The `Software\7-Zip\FM\PanelPath0` value records the folder that was active in the 7-Zip left panel at the time of the last registry write:

```
c:\users\vmarr\desktop\working\
```

This is also `FolderHistory[0]` — the most recently visited folder. After sealing `shardchain.tar` and verifying the staging folder, CROWQUILL returned to their desktop working directory. This is where enumeration stopped.
